# Learning Flux, React, Gulp and More!
This project exists to document some of my learnings with Flux, React, Gulp and other awesome web development tools.

# Building
Thanks to nodejs and npm this is extremely easy. Simply install nodejs/npm on your system, go to the project directory that you have cloned from here and type 'npm install' into a terminal to pull down the required packages.
I install these locally, not globally, just to keep my system clean. If you want to install the packages globally you can use 'npm -g install' I believe.

Once this is done you can build the project by running npm 'run-script build'
This will use gulp to build, reactify, and browserify the project so that it can be served up to a normal web browser and viewed.
