Any context or clarification should be posted in the text box.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your title is only allowed to contain the question and necessary context. An example is &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re making nachos. What do you add to it?&amp;quot; This is allowed because the making nachos is statement is necessary for the question to make sense. However, &amp;quot;you have a friend named Paul. What do you add to nachos?&amp;quot; isn&amp;#39;t allowed because having a friend named Paul is irrelevant to the question.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;b) Any answers or examples to the question, including your own, should go in the comments as a reply to your own post.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is fairly self explanatory but to share the reasoning behind the rule, AskReddit used to be full of posts where people would post along the lines of &amp;quot;I just did the most awesome thing. What did you do today?&amp;quot; and explain their story in the text box. It was fun to see the stories but posts were upvoted because of the stories, and not because of the actual question. The other problem is no one had a single place to reply to that story so the majority of the post would be about the OP&amp;#39;s story rather than other people&amp;#39;s experiences. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule 2:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Any post asking for advice should be generic and not specific to your situation alone. You may include context about why you are asking the question in the text box, but the question shouldn&amp;#39;t be primarily about you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This ties into the thing above. You&amp;#39;re allowed to say why you&amp;#39;re asking the question in a way that gives a background but you can&amp;#39;t go so far with it that the post becomes clearly about you. Saying you&amp;#39;re asking because it came up in a conversation with your friend Paul is fine (in the text box) but you can&amp;#39;t give so much information away that it leads people into giving you personal advice. AskReddit is for everyone so we want comments to be able to apply to most people. You can ask for personal advice in the comment section but it can&amp;#39;t be in the main post. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule 3:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Askreddit is for open-ended discussion questions. Questions with definite answers, that can be researched elsewhere, provide a limited scope for discussion (yes/no, DAE, polls and surveys, etc.), or limit discussion are not appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AskReddit is a discussion sub so we require that people post discussion questions. Titles that can be answered with yes or no are removed. One way you can usually make your post follow rule 3 is to add &amp;quot;and why?&amp;quot; at the end. It doesn&amp;#39;t work in every situation so make sure the followup question (if you ask one) makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule 4:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Posting, or seeking, any identifying personal information will result in a ban without a prior warning. This includes for yourself or other people, and refers to, but is not limited to, names, phone numbers, email addresses, facebook or other social media accounts.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re really big sticklers for this. We don&amp;#39;t want personal information posted here and you will usually be banned for posting it. This includes fake personal information. Just because you made it up doesn&amp;#39;t mean no one owns that email address/phone number/etc. Unless it&amp;#39;s very clearly fake (a 555 number, for example) you risk being banned because we don&amp;#39;t have the resources or time to check every bit of personal information posted here. Posting first names are fine but nothing personally identifying. In most cases, even rule 4 bans are temporary as long as you&amp;#39;re polite in mod mail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule 8:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Mods reserve the right to remove content or restrict users&amp;#39; posting privileges as necessary if it is deemed detrimental to the subreddit or to the experience of others. All users are expected to be respectful to other users at all times. Personal attacks or comments that insult or demean a specific user or group of users will be removed and regular or egregious violations will result in bans.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People accuse us all the time of removing posts because we don&amp;#39;t agree with them and that&amp;#39;s not something that happens. I can&amp;#39;t recall any times a post was removed under rule 8 unless it broke a different rule too.

One thing we unfortunately have to do sometimes is ban a troll and the person they were trolling because the person being trolled lashed out and started making personal attacks. If someone is trolling you, please let us know so we can take care of it. If you handle it yourself and go too far, we may have to ban you and that&amp;#39;s not something we want to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We also don&amp;#39;t allow racism, sexism, transphobia, or other bigoted behavior.
